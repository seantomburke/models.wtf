# Phase 4: Audit & Improvement Plan

> **Status:** DRAFT  
> **Date:** July 17, 2026  
> **Scope:** Comprehensive audit of models.wtf after Phases 1-3

---

## Executive Summary

After completing Phases 1-3 (SEO, UX/Export, Analytics/Accessibility), models.wtf is a solid educational platform with professional features. However, a thorough audit reveals 12-15 improvement opportunities ranging from content gaps to feature enhancements that would significantly improve user experience and business value.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize Phases 4A (Quick Wins) and 4B (Content) as they have highest ROI and user impact.

---

## Audit Findings

### 1. **Content & Educational Gaps**

**Current State:**
- Learn section has ~8 topics (what is an LLM, GPT, context window, etc.)
- Minimal cross-linking between Learn topics and Compare page
- No "comparison guides" (e.g., "Anthropic vs OpenAI")
- Limited model-specific education (why choose this model?)
- No glossary or searchable term index

**Findings:**
- Users reading Compare page have no easy way to learn *why* a score matters
- Learning paths are not optimized (no "beginner → intermediate → advanced")
- No "common questions" section (FAQ)
- Missing educational content on newer concepts (multimodal, vision, reasoning models)

**Impact:** Users abandon site if they don't understand the data

**Opportunity:** Add ~10-15 new educational resources with deep internal linking

---

### 2. **Model Details & Depth**

**Current State:**
- Compare page shows: name, provider, benchmarks, price, context, capabilities
- Each model has a `blurb` (1-2 sentence description)
- No detailed model pages
- No "why use this model" explanations per model

**Findings:**
- Users can't read detailed specs or use cases for each model
- No model comparison flows (e.g., "if you need X, choose between A and B")
- Missing links to official model documentation
- No model release notes or changelog
- No capability comparison matrix (e.g., function calling, JSON mode)

**Impact:** Users must leave site to learn more about specific models

**Opportunity:** Create model detail pages with specs, use cases, links, changelog

---

### 3. **Search & Discoverability**

**Current State:**
- No search functionality
- No model filtering by capability (only by provider or open-source)
- No tagging system
- Breadcrumbs added in Phase 3, but minimal internal linking

**Findings:**
- Users can't quickly find models matching their specific needs
- No way to filter by: reasoning capability, vision support, function calling, etc.
- Quiz is only guided filter (other users use Compare, which is overwhelming)
- No related model suggestions

**Impact:** Users get lost or use external sources (Hugging Face, etc.)

**Opportunity:** Add search, advanced filtering, and related model suggestions

---

### 4. **Interactive Features**

**Current State:**
- Quiz (decision flow for recommendations)
- Compare (table with sort/filter)
- Graph (scatter plot with axis selection)
- Calculator (token cost calculator)
- Learn (static educational content)

**Findings:**
- Quiz outputs recommendation but doesn't explain trade-offs deeply

- No "compare these 5 models" quick comparison tool
- No benchmark explanation on hover (just tooltip)
- No "what's new" feed for model releases
- No ability to view historical performance or price changes

**Impact:** Limited engagement and decision-making support

**Opportunity:** Add bookmarks, quick comparisons, model history, better explanations

---

### 5. **Data Quality & Freshness**

**Current State:**
- Data last updated: shown in footer
- Manual data updates (no automation)
- Benchmarks from various sources (provider-published, independent runs)

- No alerts for new models or price changes
- Manual updates create staleness risk

**Impact:** Users uncertain about data recency and reliability

**Opportunity:** Add data quality indicators, deprecation warnings, and change log

---
