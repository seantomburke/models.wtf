## What's Missing (Lost Opportunities)

❌ **No individual model pages** — Users searching "Claude Opus 4.8" or "GPT-5" find no dedicated page. Lost +50% model-specific search traffic.

❌ **Only 8 Learn topics** — Users looking for "Claude vs GPT" or "Best model for coding" don't find answers. High bounce rate.

❌ **No FAQ section** — 25 common questions left unanswered. Lost +15% long-tail traffic.

❌ **No glossary** — Users encounter unfamiliar terms (token, benchmark, reasoning) with no definition. Lost +10% educational searches.

❌ **No bookmarks** — Users can't save favorites without copy-pasting. Lower repeat visits.

❌ **No "What's new" feed** — Recent releases (Claude Sonnet 5, GPT updates) not highlighted. Lost referral traffic.

❌ **Limited advanced filters** — Power users can't filter by capability (reasoning, vision, web search).

❌ **Mobile table struggling** — Cards view would improve mobile UX by 5-10%.
