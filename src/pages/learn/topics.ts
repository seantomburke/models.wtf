          'Doodle-525 is the second model in our lab, and its model card shows what one extra layer costs and buys. It reads the same 64-pixel grid as Doodle-64, but instead of mapping pixels straight to an answer, it spends 448 weights (plus 7 biases) turning pixels into 7 stroke detections, then 70 more weights turning strokes into 10 digit scores. Total: 525 parameters for a 10-way choice, where Doodle-64 needed 64 for a 2-way choice.',
          'That budget is the whole story of neural network design: more possible answers and subtler distinctions demand more parameters, and layering lets the parameters share work. The 7 stroke detectors are reused by all 10 digits, the way an LLM\'s early layers are reused by every sentence it will ever read.',

With ten digits that trick collapses. An 8 contains every pixel of a 3, a 9 contains every pixel of a 7—so no single pixel is evidence for exactly one digit.',
