# Models.fyi data layer

All model and benchmark data is static and hardcoded here. This is deliberate
(see the root README): no database until the product needs one.

## Layout

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `types.ts` | The schema. Start here. |
| `providers.ts` | AI companies / open-source orgs |
| `benchmarks.ts` | Benchmarks with plain-language (ELI5) descriptions |
| `models.ts` | The models: pricing, context windows, capabilities, scores |
| `index.ts` | Public entry point. Import from here only. |

## Rules

- **Never write facts from memory.** Every price, context window, and score
  must come from a source checked at refresh time (provider docs, leaderboards).
- **Missing beats fabricated.** If no reliable published score exists, omit the
  key from `scores`. The UI renders it as "—".
- Prices are USD per 1M tokens, list price (ignore short-term intro discounts).
- Open-source models have `null` prices (hosting cost varies by vendor).

## Refresh process

1. Re-research each provider's current lineup, pricing, and context windows
   (provider docs first, then leaderboards such as vals.ai, llm-stats.com,
   artificialanalysis.ai for scores).
2. Update `models.ts` / `benchmarks.ts` / `providers.ts`.
3. Bump `dataSourcedAt` in `index.ts`.
4. Run `npm run validate` (schema + sanity checks; also runs in CI).
