# Models.fyi data layer

All model and benchmark data is static and hardcoded here. This is deliberate
(see the root README): no database until the product needs one.

## Layout

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `types.ts` | The schema. Start here. |
| `providers.ts` | AI companies / open-source orgs |
| `benchmarks.ts` | Benchmarks with plain-language (ELI5) descriptions |
| `models.ts` | The models: pricing, context windows, capabilities, scores |
| `index.ts` | Public entry point. Import from here only. |

## Rules

- **Never write facts from memory.** Every price, context window, and score
  must come from a source checked at refresh time (provider docs, leaderboards).
- **Missing beats fabricated.** If no reliable published score exists, omit the
  key from `scores`. The UI renders it as "—".
- Prices are USD per 1M tokens, list price (ignore short-term intro discounts).
- Open-source models have `null` prices (hosting cost varies by vendor).

## Refresh process

1. Re-research each provider's current lineup, pricing, and context windows
   (provider docs first, then leaderboards such as vals.ai, llm-stats.com,
   artificialanalysis.ai for scores).
2. Update `models.ts` / `benchmarks.ts` / `providers.ts`.
3. Bump `dataSourcedAt` in `index.ts`.
4. Run `npm run validate` (schema + sanity checks; also runs in CI).

Last refreshed: **2026-07-20** (GPT-5.6 GPQA and independent coding evals
backfilled). Provider-published evals win over third-party harness
runs; where a number is third-party or contested, `models.ts` carries an
inline comment saying so.

2026-07-20 refresh notes:

- **GPT-5.6 GPQA corrected from OpenAI's GA table:** Sol is 94.6, Terra is
  92.9, and Luna is 92.3. Sol previously showed an older Artificial Analysis
  run (94.1), while Terra and Luna were missing. OpenAI still publishes no
  SWE-bench Verified scores for the family.
- **Vals AI coding runs backfilled:** its July 17 uniform mini-swe-agent
  SWE-bench Verified run reports Sol 96.2, Kimi K3 93.4, Luna 93.0, and Grok
  4.5 86.6. Its July 16 Terminus 2 Terminal-Bench run provides independent
  comparisons for Sol (85.77), Kimi K3 (80.90), and Luna (79.03); provider
  scores remain displayed where available. Luna's earlier tbench.ai Codex run
  was 75.7, but the provenance UI currently presents one independent
  counterpart, so it now shows the newer Vals run.
- Checked and unchanged: no post-July-19 tbench.ai entries for Kimi K3,
  Inkling, GPT-5.6 Sol, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Qwen 3.6, GLM-5.2, or Haiku 4.5;
  Kimi K3 weights remain promised for July 27; Gemini 3.5 Pro remains
  unreleased and no official Gemini 3.6 model is listed.

ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models, deepmind.google/models/gemini, and
anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5.

2026-07-19 refresh notes:

- **Kimi K3 added as Moonshot AI's flagship** (released 2026-07-16: 2.8T-param
  sparse MoE, 1M context, native vision, always-on reasoning, $3/$15).
  GPQA Diamond 93.5, Terminal-Bench 2.1 88.3, and HLE 56.0 (with tools) are
  all Moonshot-published — no independent runs yet (K3 is absent from
  tbench.ai's 17-row leaderboard). Moonshot publishes no SWE-bench
  Verified/Pro (its launch table uses DeepSWE/ProgramBench/FrontierSWE
  instead). Open weights are promised by 2026-07-27 — flip `openSource`
  and null the prices if that lands.
- **Inkling added as Thinking Machines' first model** (released 2026-07-15:
  975B MoE / 41B active, Apache 2.0 open weights on Hugging Face, up to 1M
  context, multimodal text/image/audio). All scores are from TML's launch
  eval table (effort=0.99): SWE-bench Verified 77.6, SWE-bench Pro public
  54.3, GPQA Diamond 87.2, Terminal-Bench 2.1 63.8, HLE 46.0 (with tools).
  Prices are null per the open-weights convention (hosted APIs exist on
  Together/Fireworks/Modal/Databricks/Baseten at varying rates).
- **Gemini 3.5 Pro did NOT ship on July 17.** Bloomberg and 9to5Google
  (July 16) report the launch slipped again — the third missed deadline —
  over coding-benchmark shortfalls and hallucination issues; Google may ship
  a stopgap "Gemini 3.6 Flash" instead. Several aggregator articles claiming
  a July 17 GA are churn: deepmind.google still lists 3.5 Pro as "coming
  soon", there is no model card, and the Gemini API pricing page lists only
  gemini-3.5-flash and gemini-3.1-pro-preview. Still excluded.
- **Haiku 4.5 GPQA re-verified as unpublished**: Anthropic's announcement
  publishes SWE-bench Verified 73.3 and Terminal-Bench only; third-party
  GPQA numbers still conflict (73.0 / 67.2 / 67). Stays omitted.
- Checked and unchanged: tbench.ai still has no GPT-5.6 Sol, Grok 4.1 Fast,
  GLM-5.2, DeepSeek V4 Pro, or Qwen 3.6 entries; existing annotated runs
  (Opus 4.8 78.9, Sonnet 5 74.6, Terra 78.4, Luna 75.7, Grok 4.5 79.3,
  Muse Spark 76.2, Gemini 3.1 Pro 65.8) match our inline comments.

2026-07-14 second-pass refresh notes:

- **Annotated Anthropic Terminal-Bench numbers with tbench.ai Claude Code
  runs.** Opus 4.8's published 74.6 (Terminus 2, per its system card) has an
  independent Claude Code run at 78.9; Sonnet 5's published 80.4 has a
  Claude Code run at 74.6. Scores unchanged per the provider-wins
  convention; inline comments added. (We also verified the published
  numbers against launch coverage — the 80.4/74.6 pair looked like a
  possible row-misalignment from the leaderboard, but both are genuinely
  Anthropic-published: Sonnet 5 announcement and Opus 4.8 system card
  §8.3.)
- **Rejected leads:** an llm-stats.com search snippet claimed "Gemini 3.2
  Pro", "DeepSeek V4.5", and "Llama 5" joined the July leaderboards — all
  three are phantom names (no such releases exist; Llama 5 was already
  debunked 7/13 as a misnaming of Muse Spark 1.1). A Lushbinary post cites
  "GPT-5.6 Sol Ultra 91.9" on Terminal-Bench 2.1 — that is a max-effort
  config from a secondary source; Sol's 88.8 OpenAI-published number stays.
- **Sonnet 5 intro pricing ignored:** $2/$10 promotional pricing runs until
  2026-08-31, but per convention we list the $3/$15 list price.
- Checked and unchanged: Gemini 3.5 Pro still not GA (still no model card,
  docs, or pricing; reporting still points at July 17); no new flagship
  releases July 14 (news is business-side: OpenAI/government stake, TSMC,
  Anthropic IPO prep); GPT-5.6 Sol still absent from tbench.ai; Terra/Luna
  GPQA still unpublished (Artificial Analysis shows only composite index);
  Sol SWE-bench Verified still unpublished; no 2.1 runs yet for DeepSeek V4
  Pro / Qwen 3.6 / GLM-5.2 / Grok 4.1 Fast.

2026-07-14 morning refresh notes:

- **tbench.ai now has official Terminal-Bench 2.1 runs for the models we
  were watching.** Muse Spark 1.1 gained a score (76.2, mini-SWE-agent) —
  previously omitted because Meta had published only a 2.0 run. Grok 4.5
  (79.3, Cursor CLI), GPT-5.6 Terra (78.4, Codex), and Luna (75.7, Codex)
  got independent runs that land well below the providers' self-reported
  numbers; per the convention above the provider numbers stay, with the
  independent runs noted in inline comments. GPT-5.6 Sol is still absent
  from the leaderboard.
- **Rejected lead:** a search snippet attributed "74 on SWE-bench Verified,
  NIST CAISI-verified" to GPT-5.6 Terra; the underlying article (o-mega.ai)
  actually says that figure is CAISI's DeepSeek V4 Pro run. Nothing added.
- Checked and unchanged: OpenAI still publishes no GPQA/SWE-bench Verified
  for the GPT-5.6 family; Haiku 4.5 GPQA still has no verifiable source
  (benchlm.ai shows none); Gemini 3.5 Pro still not GA (no model card,
  docs, or pricing — reporting now points at July 17); no new flagship
  releases July 13–14; no 2.1 runs yet for DeepSeek V4 Pro / Qwen 3.6 /
  GLM-5.2 / Grok 4.1 Fast.

2026-07-13 second-pass refresh notes:

- **Muse Spark 1.1 added as Meta's flagship** (released 2026-07-09 by Meta
  Superintelligence Labs, `muse-spark-1.1`, $1.25/$4.25, 1M context, 256K max
  output, reasoning with adjustable effort). It is closed-weights on the new
  Meta Model API — Meta's pivot away from open-weights Llama — so the `meta`
  provider is now `openSource: false` while the Llama 4 models keep their
  model-level open flags (they remain Meta's newest open weights). SWE-bench
  Pro 61.5 is Meta-published; GPQA Diamond 88.4 is an Artificial Analysis
  independent run; Terminal-Bench is omitted because Meta published only a
  2.0 run (80.0) and we track 2.1 only. Meta published no SWE-bench Verified.
  Note: several outlets covered this release as "Llama 5" — that name is
  wrong; Wikipedia and deeplearning.ai confirm the Llama line ended at 4.
- Meta was also added to the quiz's company-preference options now that it
  sells API access like the other closed providers.
- Checked and unchanged: no new tbench.ai Terminal-Bench 2.1 entries for our
  models beyond what the morning pass recorded (Grok 4.5 and GPT-5.6 still
  absent from the official leaderboard); GPT-5.6 Terra/Luna GPQA still
  unpublished (Artificial Analysis shows only composite index scores);
  Gemini 3.5 Pro is still unreleased (third-party reports point at July 17
  with no official Google model card, docs, or pricing — excluded until GA).

2026-07-13 morning refresh notes:

- **Grok 4.5 replaced Grok 4.3** as xAI's flagship (launched 2026-07-08,
  `grok-4.5`, $2/$6, 500K context — long-context requests above 200K bill
  higher). Its SWE-bench Pro (64.7) and Terminal-Bench 2.1 (83.3) numbers are
  xAI self-reported with no independent verification yet; GPQA (93.1) is an
  Artificial Analysis run. xAI published no SWE-bench Verified.
- **GPQA backfill from Artificial Analysis independent runs:** GPT-5.6 Sol
  94.1, Claude Sonnet 5 91.1. OpenAI's circulating 94.6 for Sol is still not
  on any openai.com page, so it remains excluded.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5 GPQA stays omitted:** only conflicting third-party
  numbers circulate (67.2 / 64.6 / 67) and no exact leaderboard value could
  be verified.
- Still no published numbers found for: GPT-5.6 Terra/Luna GPQA and
  SWE-bench Verified, Gemini 3.5 Flash GPQA/SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-Bench
  2.1 runs for DeepSeek V4 Pro / Qwen 3.6 / GLM-5.2 / Grok 4.1 Fast.

Dataset conventions decided at this refresh:

- **MMLU was dropped.** Only 3 of 16 models had a reliably sourced plain-MMLU
  score (no 2026 flagship launch publishes it), below our 4-model floor for
  keeping a column.
- **Terminal-Bench numbers are 2.1 only.** Published 2.0/1.0 results (Haiku
  4.5, Gemini 3.1 Pro from Google, Qwen 3.6) are excluded, not converted.
- **"Qwen 3.6" means Qwen3.6-35B-A3B**, the flagship open-weights release
  (not the closed "Plus"/Max-Preview variants).
- **DeepSeek V4 Pro figures are the tech report's "Think Max" mode.**
- GPT-5.6 GPQA numbers circulating (94.6/92.9/92.3) are disputed (Vellum and
  MarkTechPost report OpenAI published none), so they are omitted.
