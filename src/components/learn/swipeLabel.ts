/**
 * The label/delete state machine behind the swipe deck in the training lab.
 *
 * Pure data, no React, no DOM: the deck component translates pointer gestures
 * and button presses into these actions, and this module decides what they
 * mean. Keeping it pure makes the labelling rules unit-testable without
 * simulating a single pointer event.
 *
 * The deck walks a queue of card indices. Labelling a card removes it from the
 * queue; swiping up deletes it from the training set entirely. Cards can also
 * be sent back to the queue (relabelling), which is how "remove" works in the
 * labelled tray.
