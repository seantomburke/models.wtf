/**
 * Deferred PostHog loading.
 *
 * The analytics SDK used to be a static import in main.tsx, which put ~230kB of
 * third-party JavaScript on the critical path: the browser had to download,
 * parse, and run it before React could mount and paint anything. Nothing on
 * screen depends on it, so it now loads after first paint.
 *
 * Two consequences to handle:
 *
 * 1. Events fired before the SDK arrives (early `$pageview`, a fast click)
 *    would otherwise vanish. `queue` records them and `flush` replays them in
 *    order once the real client is live.
 * 2. `usePostHog()` reads a client out of React context during the first
 *    render, so the provider needs *something* immediately. `stub` is that
 *    stand-in — it captures into the queue and no-ops everything else.
 *
 * We import the `slim` build deliberately: it drops surveys, product tours, and
 * the other extensions this site never calls, roughly halving the download.
 * Only `capture` is used anywhere in the app (see src/lib/posthog.ts and
 * src/lib/posthog-events.ts), so nothing else needs to survive the swap.
