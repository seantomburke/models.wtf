 * before seeing anything, on any entry point. It is easy to regress by accident
 * because the cost is invisible in source review: a single top-level `import`
 * in a widely-imported module (routeMeta.ts is imported by every page) silently
 * pulls a whole dataset into the shared chunk. That is exactly how the FAQ,
 * glossary, and release corpora came to ship on all 58 routes.
 *
 * Measured gzipped, because that is what the network actually transfers.
